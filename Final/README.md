## Abstract

<p align="center">
The ubiquitous accessibility and explosive increase of image data has resulted in the property of research in image retrieval. In this paper, we address the task of text-based image retrieval, to select a set of images from a large image database. We vectorized the query descriptions to a sparse binary matrix, employed PLS Regression to learn the common subspace between the visual and textual features, made distance-based relevant image predictions, and rank the relevant images based on a combination of predicted l2-distance and category Jaccard similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes both visual and semantic meanings of the cross-modal information, outperforming other teams on Kaggle competition, and can exploit large scale vision and language datasets for knowledge transfer.
